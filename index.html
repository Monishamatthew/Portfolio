        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p class="i1">Hi! I’m Monisha, a third-year Computer Science and Business Systems (CSBS) student with a strong interest in web development and a growing curiosity for the world of programming. I’m currently learning to build simple and user-friendly websites using HTML and CSS, and I enjoy the creative process of turning ideas into functional web pages.
    </p>
    <p class="i1">
    While I’m still in the early stages of my development journey, I’ve gained basic coding knowledge in C, C++, and Java through my academic coursework and personal practice. These languages have helped me understand the fundamentals of logic building, syntax, and problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p class="i1">
    Being a CSBS student has allowed me to explore both technical skills and business thinking, which I believe is a great combination for working on real-world tech projects. I’m also learning about subjects like Data Structures, DBMS, and Software Engineering, which help me understand how software is planned, built, and managed.
    </p>
    <p class="i1">
    I enjoy learning at my own pace, exploring online tutorials, building small projects, and experimenting with code. Whether it's a simple portfolio site or a small application, I believe every step counts in the journey of becoming a better developer.
    </p>
    <p class="i1">
    In the future, I hope to improve my coding skills, explore backend technologies, and become more confident in full web development. I’m always open to learning new things, collaborating on projects, and growing both technically and personally.
    </p>
